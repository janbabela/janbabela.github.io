			<h1>Melodiff MusicLDM v2</h1>
            <p>This is next version after <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/JanBabela/Riffusion-Melodiff-v1" target="_blank">Melodiff Riffusion v1</a> </p>
            <p>Melodiff MusicLDM continues to explore the idea of using the audio to audio pipeline of Stable Difussion audio models for creating cover versions of songs.</p>
			<p><br>Melodiff MusicLDM uses <a href="https://huggingface.co/ucsd-reach/musicldm" target="_blank">MusicLDM model</a> as base model for audio generation.</p>
            <p>What was done and what is presented here: Deconstructing the base pipeline and reconstructing back for audio to audio modifications.</p>
            <p>No new model training, nor finetuning was done, only modifications to base pipeline.</p>
            <p><br>MusicLDM generates audio of better quality compared to Riffusion (first) model. It generates samples of length 10s compared to 5s samples of previous model.</p>
            <p>Also speed of generation improved: previously it took about 8s to generate 5s long sample of mono audio. Now it takes about 8s to generate 10s long sample of  stereo audio.</p>
            <p>Also consistency. Previosly only about 30% of modified samples were good (or ok) and some prompt and seed play was needed to find good sound quality.</p>
            <p>Now about 70% of modified samples are good (or ok).</p>
            <p>Again longer modifications are possible by splitting, modifying and concatenating back the samples.</p>
            <p>Underlying MusicLDM model is two years old. It would be interesting to try new models, which have notably better quality.</p>
